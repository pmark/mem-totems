# 🌿 Design Context & Inspiration

## Genre Lineage
Mem: Totems merges:
- The **memory puzzle clarity** of *Concentration / Memory Match*  
- The **adventure pacing** of *Zelda: Minish Cap*  
- The **collection depth** of *Pokémon*  
- The **run-based replayability** of *Hades*  

## Design Pillars
1. **Memory as Magic** — Remembering patterns is a gameplay power.  
2. **Light Complexity** — RPG depth without cognitive overload.  
3. **Emotional Companionship** — Player bonds with one creature per run.  
4. **Replayability via Discovery** — Procedural maps, essence crafting, evolving lore.  
5. **Mobile-first Intuition** — One-thumb control, satisfying audiovisual feedback.

## Visual Style
- Hand-painted 2D pixel art (32×32 tiles).
- Palette: soft, saturated hues with bright elemental effects.
- Inspirations: *Ni No Kuni*, *Tunic*, *Children of Morta*.

## Competitor Comparison
| Game | Shared Trait | Distinguishing Factor |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| Pokémon | Creature collection | No turn-based combat; real-time memory gameplay |
| Moonlighter | Procedural dungeons | Simpler combat, memory-driven discovery |
| Tunic | Mystery & art direction | Family-friendly tone, less cryptic |
| Hades | Roguelite structure | Gentler difficulty curve, mobile UI |

## Development Goals
- Modular specs → quick Copilot-assisted prototyping.  
- Extendable by community through Markdown-defined systems.  
- Balanced tone: *serious adventure meets cozy exploration.*
