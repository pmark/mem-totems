# 🧭 Mem: Totems — Project Overview

## Purpose
**Mem: Totems** is a 2D mobile-friendly roguelite adventure game where players explore magical biomes, activate mysterious totems, and collect **essence energy** through memory-based gameplay.  
The player, a young **Spirit Tamer**, restores balance to the world by matching elemental patterns that release or bind powerful spirit creatures.

## Core Vision
- Make a **memory-matching mechanic** feel exciting and adventurous, not static.
- Combine **exploration**, **combat**, and **collection** in a single continuous flow.
- Deliver a mobile experience that’s **intuitive, tactile, and emotionally satisfying**.
- Encourage replayability through **procedural maps** and **essence crafting** systems.

## Key Features
- ⚡ **Action-Memory Hybrid:** Matching identical totems on the map yields essence rewards; mismatches spawn enemies.  
- 🧠 **Essence System:** Players gather and combine elemental essences to craft and evolve new creatures.  
- 🐾 **Companion Mechanic:** Choose one bonded creature to fight alongside you per run.  
- 🔁 **Roguelite Structure:** Each run is a new adventure; captured essences persist and fuel long-term progression.  
- 🗺️ **Tilemap World:** Modular 2D rooms built with layered tilemaps for quick iteration and procedural assembly.  
- 🧩 **Light RPG Growth:** Creature bonding, upgrades, and unlockable relics create depth without complexity.

## Audience
- Kids (ages 7+) and families who enjoy accessible action and collection games.
- Fans of *Zelda: Minish Cap*, *Moonlighter*, *Pokémon*, and *Tunic*.
- Developers interested in expanding the system via modular extensions.

## Tech Goals
- Fast iteration using **GitHub Codespaces + Obsidian + Copilot**.
- Modular architecture supporting AI-assisted content generation.
- Clean, readable code written in **TypeScript (Phaser 3)** or **Godot 4 GDScript**.

## MVP Definition
A single biome (Forest), one companion creature, procedural tilemap generation, totem matching, combat, and essence accumulation loop playable on mobile.
